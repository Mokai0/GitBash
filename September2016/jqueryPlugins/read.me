**By Sunday September 25**
* Complete jQuery Plugins on Treehouse (as well as Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript).
* Write the code **on your own machine** by **following along with the videos rather than using/downloading Treehouse's workspaces code.**
* Make git commits **early** and **often** as you reach milestones throughout your projects.
* Push all your code to GitHub. **We will want to see your jquery-plugins repo with the following**:
-- Sticky Navigation Bar
-- jQuery Carousel
* Email the link to your jquery-plugins repo (not a file attachment!) to **therealbenwiley@gmail.com**.
* Stuck? Ask questions here on Slack!
